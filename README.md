Egg and sperm freezing at Ayuh Fertility Centre is a reliable fertility preservation option for individuals who want to delay parenthood due to personal, medical, or professional reasons. Egg freezing (oocyte cryopreservation) helps women preserve their fertility before their egg quality declines with age or due to medical treatments like chemotherapy. Similarly, sperm freezing (semen cryopreservation) allows men to store healthy sperm for future use. The process involves collecting eggs or sperm, safely freezing them in liquid nitrogen, and storing them until the individual or couple is ready to undergo fertility treatment. This method is ideal for cancer patients, those undergoing gender transition, or anyone who wants to delay conception for lifestyle or career goals. Ayuh Fertility Centre ensures a safe and advanced cryopreservation environment with high success rates for future fertilization. The preserved eggs and sperm can be used later in procedures like IVF or ICSI. This proactive step gives individuals more control over their reproductive choices.
